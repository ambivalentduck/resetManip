To do:

1. Have matrix of fit qualities (trials, Reset types)
2. Sort each column
3. Plot each column

4. Find reset time (excluding VERY early reset and VERY late reset) weighted by fit quality
---Fit quality should be *added* fidelity, not total fidelity
---For reset=0, inf, always 0.

5. Some sort of stats on added quality to prove significance
