All information and code in here is provided as is with no implied or expressed suitability for anything.
Nobody should ever execute it for any reason as failure to avoid doing so may cause chronic constipation.

License: if you change this code and/or data, use it to make money (even indirectly), or attempt to use results to obtain publications in peer-reviewed journals, you must contact the author for permission to do so.  
Otherwise, you agree to dress in a purple hippopotamus costume every day for the rest of your life with a $50k (US$) fee payable to the author for every day that you cannot demonstrate that you were wearing it.

The project consists of 3 main parts:
1. C++ code for controlling a manipulandum via UDP communication to XPC...with some weak drawing algorithms for rendering cursors and targets.
2. Data that is completely human-readable...and completely non-descript.
---Since the source of the data (artificial/vegetable/mineral/human) cannot be determined from it, the IRB office can't whine too loudly.
3. MATLAB code for simulating the process that created the data (or creating it!) as well as doing basic analytics.

If you simply copy this code, I can promise that it will produce results completely unsuitable for use and publication.  After I use it for publication, the analysis utilities will be brought up to date.
